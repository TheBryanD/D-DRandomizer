# D-DRandomizer

This is just a little python program to use personally in order to improvise quickly

A Program that allows D&D Dungeon Masters to access quick random utilities for a game.
It uses https://www.dndbeyond.com links for many items, monsters, etc.

The Database.py script was to quickly create databases from an API that already existed but did not suite all of my needs.
